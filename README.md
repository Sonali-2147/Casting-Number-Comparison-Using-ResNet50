# Casting Number Detection and Comparison using ResNet

This project uses a pretrained ResNet50 model to detect and compare casting numbers from images. The goal is to find out if two images contain the same casting numbers by calculating the similarity between their embeddings. The model utilizes the ResNet50 architecture, which is pretrained on ImageNet, and the image embeddings are extracted and compared using cosine similarity.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `torch`: PyTorch library for machine learning
- `torchvision`: Computer vision library for pre-trained models
- `PIL`: Python Imaging Library for image processing
- `opencv-python`: OpenCV library for computer vision tasks
- `numpy`: For numerical operations

Install required libraries:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision pillow opencv-python numpy
```

## Files

- **casting_number_detection.py**: Main script that processes the images and compares their casting numbers.
- **image1.jpeg**: Sample image of a casting number.
- **image2.jpg**: Another sample image for comparison.

## How It Works

1. **Image Preprocessing**: The input images are preprocessed by resizing them to 224x224 pixels and normalizing using ImageNet statistics.
   
2. **Feature Extraction**: The ResNet50 model (pretrained on ImageNet) is used to extract embeddings (features) from the images. Only the convolutional layers are used, excluding the classification layer.

3. **Cosine Similarity**: The cosine similarity is calculated between the embeddings of the two images. The similarity score determines whether the images represent the same casting number.

4. **Thresholding**: If the similarity score exceeds the predefined threshold (0.95 by default), it is considered a match.

## Usage

1. Replace `image1_path` and `image2_path` with the paths to the images you want to compare.
2. Run the `casting_number_detection.py` script.

### Example:

```python
image1_path = "path/to/image1.jpg"
image2_path = "path/to/image2.jpg"
compare_casting_numbers_resnet(image1_path, image2_path)
```

Output:

- If the casting numbers match:
    ```
    TRUE Casting numbers match! (Similarity: 0.97)
    ```
- If the casting numbers do not match:
    ```
    FALSE Casting numbers DO NOT match! (Similarity: 0.75)
    ```

## Customization

- **Threshold**: Adjust the similarity threshold in the `compare_casting_numbers_resnet()` function. The default is 0.95.
- **Model**: You can replace ResNet50 with other models from `torchvision.models`, depending on your use case.
